# Jekyll tutorial on Happy Coding by Kevin Workman

Kevin has a bunch of tutorial on his [website](https://happycoding.io/). Go to Tutorials tab, under HTML, you can find his [Jekyll Tutorial](https://happycoding.io/tutorials/html/jekyll).

Remember to add a **dot** (`.`) just before the / to indicate parent folder instead of root. For instance:

```html
<link rel="stylesheet" type="text/css" href="./styles.css">
<a href="./index.html">Home</a>
        <a href="./contact.html">Contact</a>
        <a href="./beach.html">Beach</a>
        ```
